  <p><b>Basic concepts of Coding</b></p> 
Learned the web is composed of the following:<br><br>
1.<b> HTML: </b>HyperText Markup Language; the heart of the web<br>
2. <b>URLs: </b>The hyperlinks to navigate between pages <br>
3. <b> HTTP: </b> Computer protocols and, <br>
4. <b>Web Applications: </b><em>(don't remember the specifics of this one)</em><br>
<br> Learned the difference between 'inline' and 'block' tags' and their significance, though details about when to use one over the other wasn't covered. 
The Absolute fun<b>EST</b> part was learning about the tags that allowed me to start coding
immediately. <a href="www.udacity.com"> Stephen</a> explained the process simply enough from me to be able to catch on quickly.
